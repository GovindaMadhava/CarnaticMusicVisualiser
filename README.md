# CarnaticMusicTranscriptor
Carnatic Classical Music can consist of multiple notes in a short time-frame, building a notion of complexity among the students. This music visualiser displays notes from an audio snippet.

I used this code to record violin and vocal test samples, analyzing complex frequencies in Indian Tanpura, harmonies, and string behavior, while also handling edge cases to ensure accurate transcription for multiple octaves, polyphony, and imperfect notes.
